# Loops, conditions and parsing

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about loops (`while`, `until` and `for`), condition statements (`if`, `else`, `elif` and `case`), shebangs and how to create SSH keys with **Bash**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
